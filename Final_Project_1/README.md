# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles, I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Data Visualization

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_count', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
    ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)

fig.suptitle('Counts of Top Skills in Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5)
plt.show()
```
